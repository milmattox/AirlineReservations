# AirlineReservations

This was my first attempt.  I really want to master the Tkinter GUI so I started by making a listbox to choose passengers from.  Then I can click on seat and then the passenger moves to another listbox.  It will show the seat if I click on an assigned passenger.  

I need to build in how to deal with lots of errors.  
Also, I need a way to type in a new passenger name.
I need to deal with economy, first, and business class requests.

I also need a way to print the boarding pass.

I would like to have all the information save to a file and be able to be retrieved from the file.
